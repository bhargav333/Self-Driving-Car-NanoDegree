    "Then i regenerated training dattaset,I almost doubled the total samples from original samples to total 102807 samples. You can see some rotated images are showing. It will take care some cases like camera shaking or place at not perfect angle. For future work, maybe can add tilt, warp and shift to the image. The dataset can be easily grow 5-10 times bigger.\n",

    "I am using 80:20 split on total dataset to get testing set samples.Then split the training set 75:25 again to get training set 61683 samples and validation set 20562 samples.\n",
    "Even in validation set, the lowest image count per class (such as stop sign) is over 200, greater than \"30 rule\", I am ok to proceed with these setting.\n",
