    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "    * Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "    * Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  \n",

    "### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by loading all of the vehicle and non-vehicle image paths from the provided dataset. The figure below shows a random sample of images from both classes of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/training_dataset.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for extracting HOG features from an image is defined by the method `get_hog_features` and is contained in the cell titled \"Define Method to Convert Image to Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).\"  The figure below shows a comparison of a car image and its associated histogram of oriented gradients, as well as the same for a non-car image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/HOG.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.\n",
    " YUV colorspace, 11 orientations, 16 pixels per cell, 2 cells per block, and `ALL` channels of the colorspace. SVC classifier for training\n",
    " \n",
    " #### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section titled \"Train a Classifier\" I trained a linear SVM with the default classifier parameters and using HOG features alone (I did not use spatial intensity or channel intensity histogram features) and was able to achieve a test accuracy of 98.23%. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section titled \"Method for Using Classifier to Detect Cars in an Image\" I adapted the method `find_cars` from the lesson materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/find_car.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/find_car1.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is shown in below iage:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/process.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of passing all of the project test images through the above pipeline are displayed in the images below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = './output_images/final.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_out.mp4)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a test video output[link to my video result](./test_video_out_2.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used a class to store previous bounding boxes upto 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is probably most likely to fail in cases where vehicles (or the HOG features thereof) don't resemble those in the training dataset, but lighting and environmental conditions might also play a role (e.g. a white car against a white background). As stated above, oncoming cars are an issue, as well as distant cars (as mentioned earlier, smaller window scales tended to produce more false positives, but they also did not often correctly label the smaller, distant cars).
